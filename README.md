## Push Local Code to Remote GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to push your local code to a remote GitHub repository:

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository**

   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository. Note down the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/new-repo.git`).

2. **Initialize Local Repository (If Not Already Initialized)**

   If your local project is not already a Git repository, open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add Remote Repository**

    Add the new GitHub repository as a remote repository: 

    ```bash
    git remote add new-origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git âœ…
    ```

    Stage and Commit Your Changes

4. **Stage all your changes and commit them:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    Push to Remote Repository

5. **Push your local changes to the remote repository:**


    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

   If your default branch is not main, replace main with your branch name (e.g., master).
   
6. **Be cautious with this step as it will overwrite the remote repository's history**:

    If you need to force push to the remote repository (overwriting its history), use the following command. 

    ```bash
    git push new-origin main -f 
    ```

    

7. **Verify the Push**

    Go to your GitHub repository in the browser and verify that your code has been successfully pushed.
